Today I was convinced that I really need to sit down, screw around,
and reinvent the fundamentals for myself to have any chance at
understanding or retaining math.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This semester I've been taking a course on algebraic topology, which
was advertised as a natural continuation of the introduction to the
subject I took last semester. It's turned out to be this insane plunge
into some neat(-looking) but ridiculously abstract homotopy theory,
with the goal of proving [the Sullivan conjecture] [sullivan]. I
really hope to understand it one day...hopefully this absurd month
(four final projects/papers!) will pass by relatively successfully and
without claiming too much of my sanity; then over the summer I can
write a bit about (and finally learn) some of the ideas that appeared
in the course.

But today I was convinced that there is something far more important I
need to do this summer: sit down, screw around, and reinvent all the
fundamentals (which I've forgotten) for myself. Indeed that whole
first paragraph was just for the sake of
contradiction/contrast. Here's the actual point of the post.

I'm also taking a course on number fields this semseter, and section
today was comprised of just our TF, the infamous [Levent Alpoge]
[levent], and me. (My current understanding: Levent is essentially

1. an unrelenting and rather talented troll,
2. a total boss.

I'm not sure if I got the order there right, but I'll leave it like
that in the hopes that he reads this.) Anyway, Levent asks me if I
want to talk about [Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic
progressions] [dirichlet]. I say yes, and that I know nothing of how
the proof goes. He's about to start talking---he says often in number
theory we have to do some algebra and some analysis, and usually the
analysis is where the deep, tricky stuff is happening; I'm only
writing that here because I want to remember that---but, true to form,
instead of actually starting the proof, he decides that today I am
Dirichlet and I will prove this theorem.

Obviously he was exaggerating and presented the bulk of the argument
(that is, the analysis), but I had to try and figure out some of the
algebra. Basically what I ended up doing is realising that, if $p \in
\mathbb{N}$ is prime and $a, n \in \mathbb{N}$ are relatively prime, one
can write the indicator function
$$
p \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
1, & p \equiv a \pod{n}, \\
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
$$
algebraically as
$$
p \mapsto \frac{1}{\varphi(n)} \sum_{\chi \in
  ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee} \chi(p)\overline{\chi(a)},
$$
where $G^\vee := \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G, \mathbb{C}^\times)$ is
the _Pontryagin dual_ of a finite abelian group $G$. Now, if I
saw this written down with this notation (and I had known that
evaluation gives an isomorphism $\mathrm{ev} : G \to G^{\vee\vee}$,
which is not hard to see if one appeals to the structure theorem for
finite abelian groups), and Levent had said "orthogonality
relations" (observe $\mathrm{ev}(g)$ is an irreducible character on
$G^\vee$ for $g \in G$), the statement would be obvious to me. Indeed
from this perspective, i.e., in hindsight, the statement is utterly
trivial.

But getting there was far from trivial. True to my own form, I
floundered while Levent hinted me towards this final result. He
started by just asking me to write down an algebraic form for that
indicator function. (To be fair, he hinted right away that this had to
do with representation theory, but I'm way too stupid to have foreseen
the result.) Indeed it took me _way_ too long (extrapolating from
$n=2,3$) to arrive at the expression
$$
p \mapsto \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}/n} e^{2\pi ik(p-a)/n}.
$$
The problem with this is that Dirichlet's theorem really has to do
with $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times$ and $\varphi(n)$, not $\mathbb{Z}/n$ and
$n$. So these _additive characters_ (as I've learned to call them in
this setting) $x \mapsto e^{2\pi ikx/n}$ just won't do. What we want
is to find the proper analogy with _multiplicative characters_ $\chi
\in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee$. This also took me ridiculously long
(after learning about Pontryagin duality), expecting na&iuml;vely that
$\sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}/n}$ would be replaced by $\prod_\chi$. But
anyway, with sufficient nudging (and profanity and "yelling at each
other", since this is how Levent does math apparently...it works...)
I got to the analogous 
$$ 
p \mapsto \frac{1}{\varphi(n)} \sum_{\chi
\in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee} \chi(p/a) = \frac{1}{\varphi(n)}
\sum_{\chi \in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee}
\chi(p)\overline{\chi(a)}.
$$

That took a lot more work than looking at the answer and declaring it
trivial. Also it made me feel like an idiot (though we decided it
would be a lot worse when, in a few years, he screams obscenities at
his students in front of five hundred of their peers). But seriously,
the exercise (i.e., screwing around at the blackboard) made me
understand everything that happened infinitely better, and in
particular forced me to think about analogies and connections I
wouldn't have otherwise noticed. To paraphrase Frost, I was forced to
think inventively, and that made all the difference.

It's definitely a clich&eacute; that doing math is the only way to
really learn it. But I think it's easy to forget this when we get all
this abstraction thrown in our faces; I end up spending a lot of time
trying to absorb and understand, and this is fine, but today has
really convinced me that it's imperative to go back later and try to
_reinvent_ (with some help, probably...) the fundamentals. I decided
to call this _learnventing_, for the obvious reason, and to pay
tribute to that troll Levent. So this summer I'm going to try to do as
much of this as possible, and hopefully it will turn into some
blogging. In particular I really want to learnvent some basic algebra
(representation theory of finite groups, Galois theory), some of the
cool consequences from all the machinery of basic algebraic topology,
and basic complex analysis.

This was my first real post. Congratulations, Arpon, you hero.
