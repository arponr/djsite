<p>Today I was convinced that I really need to sit down, screw around, and reinvent the fundamentals for myself to have any chance at understanding or retaining math.</p>


----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>This semester I've been taking a course on algebraic topology, which was advertised as a natural continuation of the introduction to the subject I took last semester. It's turned out to be this insane plunge into some neat(-looking) but ridiculously abstract homotopy theory, with the goal of proving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_conjecture" title="The Sullivan conjecture">the Sullivan conjecture</a>. I really hope to understand it one day...hopefully this absurd month (four final projects/papers!) will pass by relatively successfully and without claiming too much of my sanity; then over the summer I can write a bit about (and finally learn) some of the ideas that appeared in the course.</p>

<p>But today I was convinced that there is something far more important I need to do this summer: sit down, screw around, and reinvent all the fundamentals (which I've forgotten) for myself. Indeed that whole first paragraph was just for the sake of contradiction/contrast. Here's the actual point of the post.</p>

<p>I'm also taking a course on number fields this semseter, and section today was comprised of just our TF, the infamous <a href="http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~alpoge/" title="Levent Alpoge">Levent Alpoge</a>, and me. (My current understanding: Levent is essentially</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>an unrelenting and rather talented troll,</li>

<li>a total boss.</li>

</ol>

<p>I'm not sure if I got the order there right, but I'll leave it like that in the hopes that he reads this.) Anyway, Levent asks me if I want to talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet&#39;s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions" title="Dirichlet&#39;s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions">Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions</a>. I say yes, and that I know nothing of how the proof goes. He's about to start talking&mdash;he says often in number theory we have to do some algebra and some analysis, and usually the analysis is where the deep, tricky stuff is happening; I'm only writing that here because I want to remember that&mdash;but, true to form, instead of actually starting the proof, he decides that today I am Dirichlet and I will prove this theorem.</p>

<p>Obviously he was exaggerating and presented the bulk of the argument (that is, the analysis), but I had to try and figure out some of the algebra. Basically what I ended up doing is realising that, if <span class="math">\(p \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> is prime and <span class="math">\(a, n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> are relatively prime, one can write the indicator function <span class="math">\[

p \mapsto 

\begin{cases}

1, &amp; p \equiv a \pod{n}, \\

0, &amp; \text{otherwise},

\end{cases}

\]</span> algebraically as <span class="math">\[

p \mapsto \frac{1}{\varphi(n)} \sum_{\chi \in

  ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee} \chi(p)\overline{\chi(a)},

\]</span> where <span class="math">\(G^\vee := \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G, \mathbb{C}^\times)\)</span> is the <em>Pontryagin dual</em> of a finite abelian group <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Now, if I saw this written down with this notation (and I had known that evaluation gives an isomorphism <span class="math">\(\mathrm{ev} : G \to G^{\vee\vee}\)</span>, which is not hard to see if one appeals to the structure theorem for finite abelian groups), and Levent had said &quot;orthogonality relations&quot; (observe <span class="math">\(\mathrm{ev}(g)\)</span> is an irreducible character on <span class="math">\(G^\vee\)</span> for <span class="math">\(g \in G\)</span>), the statement would be obvious to me. Indeed from this perspective, i.e., in hindsight, the statement is utterly trivial.</p>

<p>But getting there was far from trivial. True to my own form, I floundered while Levent hinted me towards this final result. He started by just asking me to write down an algebraic form for that indicator function. (To be fair, he hinted right away that this had to do with representation theory, but I'm way too stupid to have foreseen the result.) Indeed it took me <em>way</em> too long (extrapolating from <span class="math">\(n=2,3\)</span>) to arrive at the expression <span class="math">\[

p \mapsto \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}/n} e^{2\pi ik(p-a)/n}.

\]</span> The problem with this is that Dirichlet's theorem really has to do with <span class="math">\((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varphi(n)\)</span>, not <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. So these <em>additive characters</em> (as I've learned to call them in this setting) <span class="math">\(x \mapsto e^{2\pi ikx/n}\)</span> just won't do. What we want is to find the proper analogy with <em>multiplicative characters</em> <span class="math">\(\chi \in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee\)</span>. This also took me ridiculously long (after learning about Pontryagin duality), expecting naïvely that <span class="math">\(\sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}/n}\)</span> would be replaced by <span class="math">\(\prod_\chi\)</span>. But anyway, with sufficient nudging (and profanity and &quot;yelling at each other&quot;, since this is how Levent does math apparently...it works...) I got to the analogous <span class="math">\[ 

p \mapsto \frac{1}{\varphi(n)} \sum_{\chi

\in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee} \chi(p/a) = \frac{1}{\varphi(n)}

\sum_{\chi \in ((\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times)^\vee}

\chi(p)\overline{\chi(a)}.

\]</span></p>

<p>That took a lot more work than looking at the answer and declaring it trivial. Also it made me feel like an idiot (though we decided it would be a lot worse when, in a few years, he screams obscenities at his students in front of five hundred of their peers). But seriously, the exercise (i.e., screwing around at the blackboard) made me understand everything that happened infinitely better, and in particular forced me to think about analogies and connections I wouldn't have otherwise noticed. To paraphrase Frost, I was forced to think inventively, and that made all the difference.</p>

<p>It's definitely a cliché that doing math is the only way to really learn it. But I think it's easy to forget this when we get all this abstraction thrown in our faces; I end up spending a lot of time trying to absorb and understand, and this is fine, but today has really convinced me that it's imperative to go back later and try to <em>reinvent</em> (with some help, probably...) the fundamentals. I decided to call this <em>learnventing</em>, for the obvious reason, and to pay tribute to that troll Levent. So this summer I'm going to try to do as much of this as possible, and hopefully it will turn into some blogging. In particular I really want to learnvent some basic algebra (representation theory of finite groups, Galois theory), some of the cool consequences from all the machinery of basic algebraic topology, and basic complex analysis.</p>

<p>This was my first real post. Congratulations, Arpon, you hero.</p>
