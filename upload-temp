<p>There are some <em>great</em> quotes in Pulp Fiction. I wrote some down, and thought a bit about why I love them, and the movie, so very much.</p>


----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p><em>Pulp Fiction</em> is wonderful:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is, okay? I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping she buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it. But you know what's on my mind right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Flawless transition right there, straight from quality of coffee to murder. Tarantino throws these at us in the same <em>sentence</em>, makes us think of these&mdash;to put things in Vincent's words&mdash;as in the same ballpark. (This ballpark is pretty strange, though: everyday conversation for a couple of Hollywood gangsters and their acquaintances.) The subsequent lines,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did you notice a sign out in front of my house that said &quot;Dead Nigger Storage&quot;? ... it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fucking business, that's why!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>might be some of the best words ever uttered, but I think that first bit encapsulates (at least a big part of) why this movie is so absurdly hilarious. Here we have this totally absurd, bloody, screwed up gangster world; but the characters are so goddamn cool and normal about it that that world and its problems seem just as real and acceptable as our everyday domestic world and our problems concerning gourmet and non-gourmet coffee. Here we have a guy with his head blown off in the back seat of a car, cooly narrated by Vincent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And Jules calls Marcellus with:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You've got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.</p>

<p>You get the same thing in Butch's story too. After Butch returns from that surreal sequence of events&mdash;shooting Vincent on the toilet, running over Marcellus, escaping from bondage and rescuing Marcellus from the hillbilly rapist whilst killing the gimp with a sword&mdash;he immediately finds himself back in the thick of domestic hassle. The stereotypical man-trying-to-calm-down-his-woman scene that ensues in trying to get Fabienne on the <strike>motorcycle</strike> chopper is an absolutely ridiculous and hilarious juxtaposition. Oh, and of course we have the same thing when Mia overdoses. She's there dying on the floor, one of the most intense things I've ever seen, and Vincent and Lance and Lance's wife get in a spat, just back-and-forth about a little book and getting the adrenaline. Again, brilliant.</p>

<p>Let's just end with Jules being super cool about murder again, because Jules is so good, and because only Samuel L. Jackson can say &quot;motherfucker&quot; twice consecutively.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-laying motherfucker, motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T., I'm the Guns of the Navarone! In fact, what the fuck am I doing in the back!? You're the motherfucker who should be on brain detail! We're fucking switching! I'm washing the windows, and you're picking up this nigger's skull!</p>
